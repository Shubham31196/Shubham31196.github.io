          I am a senior year student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics from the State University of New York at Buffalo. Along with my education, I am also working with Mityo as a Web Developer intern. I also did my Internship with IBM in Big data Hadoop during my sophomore and junior year to develop a (what application). These internships have not only aided me in bolstering my technical skills but also taught me to be a team player and increase my capabilities in various fields. 
Being curious and knowledge-seeking by nature, I made myself acquainted with various computer languages like C++, Java, MySQL, Python, BigData and Hadoop. 
In my free time, I play different sports like Badminton, Cricket 
Currently, I am seeking full-time opportunities starting this January 2019. <br>
